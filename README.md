Just Passed CSA â€“ Hereâ€™s My Honest Advice After 6 Months in a SN Role

Been a silent reader here for a while. I moved into a ServiceNow role at my company about 6 months ago, and Iâ€™m happy to say I just passed the CSA exam. Wanted to share what worked for me (and what didnâ€™t), in case it helps anyone else prepping for this cert.

Start with the official course ebook. Itâ€™s dry, sure, and not the most exciting readâ€”but if you go through it cover to cover and understand the content, youâ€™ll be in great shape for the exam. I used it as my main source and filled in the gaps with labs and platform experience.

Practice inside the platform. Whether you have access to an actual instance at work or a PDI, use it. Going hands-on helped way more than trying to memorize things. I made it a point to recreate everything from the ebook in a sandbox just to reinforce what I was learning.

Avoid low-quality dumps and random practice tests. I wasted time trying out free material and even some courses that just didnâ€™t reflect the real exam.

What really helped me prep properly was [Certifiedumps](https://www.certifiedumps.com/servicenow/csa-dumps.html). Their CSA exam dumps are well-organized, aligned with the real topics, and helped me test myself under realistic conditions. Plus, they offer updated questions and even a money-back guarantee if you donâ€™t passâ€”which gave me some peace of mind.

Looking back, I probably couldâ€™ve taken the exam a month or two earlier, but I kept doubting myself due to the poor quality of some of the free resources I tried. Certifiedumps cleared up that confusion for me and made sure I was actually ready.

If youâ€™re serious about passing, stay consistent, focus on official content, get hands-on, and use trusted practice resources like certifiedumps. Youâ€™ve got this.

Good luck to everyone going for the CSA or other SN certs! ðŸ‘Š
